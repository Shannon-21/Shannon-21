Most of my public repositories are projects for personal and academic learning purposes. I am graduated in University as Artificial Intelligence Technician. I work as quantitative developer using Python and C# at Nasini.

My interests are oriented towards data roles. I love learning and researching, and my goal is to become a professional in data engineering and data science. I aim to help people and organizations improve and perform advanced approaches through emerging technologies in order to grow and generate positive value in our lives.
