### Artificial Intelligence Technician and Software Developer
---

Hello ðŸ‘‹

Most of my repositories are projects for personal and academic learning purposes. I am a third-year student of the technical career in Artificial Intelligence at the National University of Rosario. I work as a GeneXus developer at Valkimia.

My interests are oriented towards data roles. I love learning and researching, and my goal is to become a professional in data engineering and data science. I aim to help people and organizations improve and perform advanced approaches through emerging technologies in order to grow and generate positive value in our lives.
