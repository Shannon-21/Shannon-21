Hello ðŸ‘‹

Most of my repositories are projects for personal and academic learning purposes. I am a second year student of the technical career in Artificial Intelligence at the National University of Rosario.

I am currently learning about machine learning modeling and backend systems, and I want to contribute to predictive analytics and natural language processing artificial intelligence modeling projects.

Browse the <a href="https://github.com/Shannon-21/Housing-Prices-Competition">Housing Price Competition</a> repository to see the improvement and progress of the machine learning model for the house price prediction for the competition in Kaggle. See <a href="https://github.com/Shannon-21/Proyecto_Pandas">Pandas Project</a> for the data analysis project with Pandas and <a href="https://github.com/Shannon-21/Django-Tutorial">Django Tutorial</a> for personal web page project.
